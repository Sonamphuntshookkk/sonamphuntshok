                  As the global economy experiences unprecedented disruption as a result of emerging technological advancements, an increasing emphasis is being placed on the importance of graduates gaining both transferable skills and specific qualifications to ensure better long-term employment outcomes in an ever-changing future global workplace. The Bachelors of Data Science and Data Analytics programme is designed to produce students with adaptive mindsets to handle job disruptions and also to take on various opportunities that are presented along the way. For that, the programme will emphasize producing highly skilled and knowledgeable graduates. In line with these challenges and uncertainties in future employment, the existing learning strategies have been modified and realigned to suit the current needs of the nation. The programme aims to provide students with adequate exposure to data handling, visualization, and curation through a series of modules in Data Science, Statistics, and Mathematics. They will then learn to integrate and apply statistical and computational principles to solve real-world problems with large-scale data. The knowledge and skills gained from this programme can be applied to make sense of what appears to be random and chaotic to human eyes. Their expertise in turning data into actionable insights will prove highly beneficial in helping the leaders and managers arrive at better strategic decisions.
                  Data experiences will play a central role in all modules, from the introductory module to the advanced capstone project or research project. The graduates, equipped with core skills, will be able to perform data wrangling, analyse the raw data gathered from various sources, and translate it into powerful, intelligent insights to make informed decisions. The graduates will also be able to obtain comprehensive analytical and technical skills covering handling, analysing, operationalizing data, and conducting data-driven quantitative and qualitative research.               </p>

                    His Majesty the Third King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck envisioned that “the students in Bhutan should catch up with the scientific and technological developments in other parts of the world. The younger generation must acquire knowledge and work hard if it is to preserve the country’s freedom and national heritage.” The task force led by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lyonpo Dawa Tshering, the late Rev. Father William Mackey, and Lopon Kharpo set out to find a suitable site for a school to live up to this vision. They chose Kanglung and in 1968 a new public school was inaugurated by His Majesty the Third King himself, and named Sherubtse, meaning ‘peak of learning’. Eight years later in 1976, Sherubtse Public School became a junior college with pre-university courses in Science. In 1978, Arts and Commerce courses were added. In July 1983, Sherubtse Junior College became a fully-fledged degree college affiliated to Delhi University. Currently, the college is affiliated to the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB).
